## How to delete my data?
If you wish to delete the entire list (All your data), you can select the *"Delete"* butotn from the lower left side of the screen, this option will prompt you to reconsider, if you're sure about deleting your data, click or tap on the *"Delete all data"* option (the pink button), otherwise just click *"Cancel"* and nothing will change, your data will be safe.

## Deleting your data is **NOT** reversible
the data is **NOT** stored on any server and there is **NO BACKUP** for deleting your data. The only device that has your data to begin with is your own, that's why this app requires no password, no logins and it offers no syncing between devices, use it at your own risk.
